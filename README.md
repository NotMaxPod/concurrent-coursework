This is a basic server and client representation designed for the coursework in the module LZSCC.232.
The server is capable of concurently sending messages across users as well transfering files to the server.

The user login information is encrypted to a database. 
The message and file history is stored in a separate database, with the sender's username and file type also being written to the database.

The usrs.db file contains some sample users that can be used for testing such as admin (password the same) and tester 1-5, with passwords being their respective numbers (1,2...)
The added files were used for testing the file transfering features.

The files used for file transfering testing during the demonstration and outside are included in the File Transfer Testing folder.
